A fun (parody) Discord Bot, written with interactions.py.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **In maintenance mode.**
Articuno has finished its purpose, and since I'm lacking of time to continue development due to studies and work in real life, the development can be considered as half-ceased. I will continue to fix existing bug (if any), but there will not be any new feature. Thank you so much for supporting Articuno for the last 3 years.

# Feature

Articuno is a multi-purpose Discord Bot that can do a wide variety of jobs, mostly with fun commands. It has a tag system (text) allows you to store and send multiple tags that suit with your server. Featuring an emoji management system, where you can steal and add emojis from other servers (Nitro or image url), remove and look up for the information about an emoji in your server. There is an image search command (powered by Google Images) allows you to look up for different images. And, Articuno also does its job as a Pokemon named bot, by having a **must-have** ``/pokedex`` command and the famous game from the franchise, Who's that Pokemon. Beside those features, Articuno offers a wide range variety of random fun command, more as a parody, that can hype up the current chat in your server.

## Highlight commands:

- ``/img``: Look up for images from Google Images. üñº

- ``/tag``: A message tag system (view, create, edit, info, delete, list). üìú

- ``/emoji``: An emoji management system (info, steal, add, remove). Those emojis from another look fancy, right? Add them to your own server with Articuno. üè°

# How to use Articuno

It is very simple. Just add him to your server, select a command from the Articuno list after typing the `/` symbol, read the command description and you are good to go.

Beside slash command, Articuno also has some commands that have prefixed message command support. (You may wonder what is a prefixed message command? Remember the old time when slash command wasn't a thing yet? You use bots with symbol and name like `$`, `.`, `h!`, `?`.)

Type `/help` to see a list of available slash commands.

Type `$help` to see a list of available prefixed message commands.
