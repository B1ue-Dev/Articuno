# Feature

Articuno is a multi-purpose Discord Bot that can do a wide variety of jobs, mostly with fun commands. It has a tag system (text) allows you to store and send multiple tags that suit with your server. Featuring an emoji management system, where you can steal and add emojis from other servers (Nitro or image url), remove and look up for the information about an emoji in your server. There is an image search command (powered by Google Images) allows you to look up for different images. Articuno also has a TTS command allows you to have a sentence spoken by different actors from Uberduck. Beside as a fun bot, Articuno also contains a moderation system with logging and a wide variety of msic commands to enhance your server experience.

## Highlight commands:

- ``/img``: Look up for images from Google Images.
